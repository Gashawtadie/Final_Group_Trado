#####   Description of the system and its purposes

Existing shopping platform; tested the end-to-end functionality of both Manual and Automation. 
Trado is a website that is used to online shopping and selling different products from this awesome website marketplace.
the main object platform is unique in its entirety and the scope of the solution it provides to 
users -retailers / buyers and suppliers / sellers what they want.
 
This project is consisting of different modules(directory) login page, sign up, add to cart, about us and, contact us, orders, payments etc each modules have its own tests class with functions and at the end we created another class on tests module(directory) to dispaly all test in one time by using of multiple inheritance run all tests sections. 

*  Description on project *

The project is done by group of work and we were six participants. for each members participates distributed tasks
equally by writing STD and automation coding from the begginnig to the end.

** Tests **

Our tests contain different types of tests, performance, GUI, 
function, compatibility, sanity but mainly divided into server and 
website python package forms. The Web python package includes Pages,
Locators, Tests and Base tests. The server part consists of Locator of 
API and Tests of API.


***  Executing program: ***

we will explain how to run the program step by step
- before all there is graphical acticterure design to test the website that leads how and where the program runs


- first of all i created Base pags: the use of base page is minimize the unwanted longer and salad code to make shorttly ad netly, i put all of them on one class in different functions and each function are retun when i use in any code 
example: find, click, send to keys, wait, assertion etc all are that i use repeatdly so if i want to use i just call it the functions

* Locators: locatrs are the paths of the webelemnt of the website and all locators are under a class and  i call it on other class by using single inheritance
* Page object: in page bjects there is a different kind of modules of website and each tests fiels are owns the code 
* Tests: tests are the final class that gather all class and using of multiple class i just make object functions and call all page object class functions and run it
* Trado Admin - this page consist of with different elements that use to manage all types of operation like orders users departments of products.
